OWASP OWTF was initially conceived and started from August 2011 by Abraham
Aranguren, as a personal project. The project was first presented publicly at
the BerlinSides conference in December 2011 and was released, as an open source
project, one week later in January 2012. It was named as OWTF then became OWASP
OWTF after being accepted as an OWASP project in August 2012.
